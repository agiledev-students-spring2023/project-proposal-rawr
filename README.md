### Project title

NYUWheels

### What and why?

NYU offers free transportation for its community members through shuttle buses and ride sharing services. Shuttles run daily on 7 different routes between 7 am and midnight, while shared car rides move passengers between NYU locations after 11 pm. With NYU’s expansive network of academic, residential and administrative buildings, its transportation program’s service area covers a big portion of New York city. However, the mobile application that currently provides information on shuttle services is lacking severely. The interface is almost medieval, and information is presented to end users in an almost unusable form: it only shows departure times and shuttle bus locations. The stops are sprawled all over the city, and there is no way to navigate the routes without looking up nearest stops on a different application such as Google Maps. To board a shuttle, the users have to find the stop nearest to their origin or destination and walk to the stop using directions from the third-party application.

NYU Wheels consolidates the information from the shuttle schedules and navigation partners to deliver a much better integrated end-user experience. It offers what the current system is missing: trip planning capabilities. On our app, users will be able to pick an origin and a destination within New York City, and the app will come up with the best route for the journey, by combining walking, NYU shuttles and ride shares, and public transportation. The hassle of navigating to and fro shuttle stops is eliminated: users receive real time directions and information on the most suitable departure time. The app can also accommodate for delays, and suggest the next best pickup spot or timing.

### For whom?

Anyone who has access to the NYU shuttles and the ride sharing app can use this app to streamline their daily transportation. 

### How?

The app’s default screen will just be a prompt to enter trip details: where to, from where, and when. NYU Wheels will instantly come up with possible trips with accurate journey information: directions on getting on NYU vehicles, ETA, transfers, etc. The app may combine multiple modes of transportation. For example, if a student wishing to go to the Museum of Modern Art is leaving from their dorm on Broome Street, the app may suggest taking the NYU Shuttle to the Tisch School of the Arts, and then getting on the public bus to MoMa. In this case, travel time is reduced, since NYU shuttles have fewer stops than MTA buses, but in other cases the trip may be entirely free of cost.

### Scope

We have to study the API of a navigation system such as TomTom maps, which is what Uber uses, to offer directions to users. We also have to design the application interface, and implement it. Along with the base work, there needs to be additional features to make the application practical for daily use, such as giving users the option to sign up and save their favorite destinations, track shuttles in real time, and sharing their location with friends for safety.
